                    A downloadable HTML and CSS Zine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A HTML/CSS zine: mostly a dialogue conversation between one's self reflecting on what it means to be human.
                </p>
                <p>A HTML/CSS version of Human Defined. I originally created this zine first using HTML with the contents being dialogue and vector art. I converted it to a PDF; however, this is the actual HTML/CSS files packaged in a ZIP for preference. This one has some web page effects (JavaScript typing effect, sticky background on desktop, repeat background on mobile, mobile responsiveness) if extracted and opened in your browser.</p>
                <p>Quote -- </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "...I don't know for certain, but it seems empty in here. Perhaps nobody can hear us, but..."—Human Mind Hesitates, Mind Fights, Mind Struggles, Mind Tries Anyway— "I've been told—and if we started discarding what I've been taught, like we've done with my horridness—"
                        
                    You're not horrid. Stop saying that.

                    Enough of all this bullsh*t. The truth is not that complicated. Yes, it's not pretty and it doesn't glimmer. The truth is not that kind of trophy. Regardless, let's define human the way that has been covered with lies. They are lies, they are tricks. Oh, and for the sake of the future just in case: a loosened grip does not mean release. Release will never happen. 
                </p>
                <p>So, here's what it truly means to be human.</p>

                <h3>Why Download the Zine? What Directly Can it Offer?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This art can offer connection thicker than hobbies, dream talk, and common interest (those things commonly define who we can "connect" to and who we ignore, avoid, or exclude).</li>
                    <li>A strengthened sense of self. The destruction of extensive categorization and a never-changing measurement of life (aka, why you deserve to exist regardless of any standards).</li>
                    <li>A subjectively beautiful story written out as a conversation with a clear direction, purpose, build-up, and nice ending.</li>
