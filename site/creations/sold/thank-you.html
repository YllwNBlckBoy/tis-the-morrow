    <h2>Intention Note...</h2>
    <p>I created this product and continue to create products to better myself. And, generally, I feel nothing towards possession/ownership, copies, and replicas. <b>As long as I benefit from my work, we all can</b>. So, I chose the <i>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</i> because it goes with my belief that society cannot move forward if we all are not moving forward.</p>
    <p>And with that said, I have a lot of work to do... a lot of things to write, a lot of things to build better for the sake of making people want to reuse it all.</p>
